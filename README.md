# Bagel-Game-With-Letters-And-Numbers


Bagel is a deduction game where you trie to guess a random three digit number generated by the computer. 
There are two programs. One with letters and numbers. The other with just numbers.

The word Bagels will appear when none of the three digits guessed is in the secret number
The word Pico will appear when one of the digits is in the secret number, but the digit is in the wrong place.
The word Fermi will appear when the guass has a correct digit in the correct place.


So if the secret number is 234 and the players guess is 324, the clue would be 'fermi pico pico".
The 'fermi' hint is from the 4 and 'pico pico' are from the 3 and 2.
